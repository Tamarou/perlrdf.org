<h1>Hacking RDF with Perl Hackathon in Oslo, Norway, April 19th-21st 2010.</h1>


<h2>The hackathon has been cancelled!</h2>

<p>Ash--</p>

<p>

We are proud to announce
the first International Hacking RDF with Perl Hackathon in Oslo in
Norway from the 19th to the 21st of April 2010.
</p>



<p>
These prominent Perl hackers are leading the event:
</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="http://kasei.us/">Gregory Todd Williams</a></strong>
is the author of <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/RDF-Trine/">RDF::Trine</a> and <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/RDF-Query/">RDF::Query</a>. He is a
Ph.D. student at the <a href="http://tw.rpi.edu/">Tetherless World Constellation</a> group at the
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and a prominent member of the SPARQL
Working Group, where he is the editor of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2009/WD-sparql11-service-description-20091022/">SPARQL 1.1 Service
Description</a>.
</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="http://tobyinkster.co.uk/">Toby Inkster</a></strong>
is the author of a large number of RDF-related Perl modules on <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/~tobyink/">CPAN</a>, including RDFa
parsers, HTML5 microdata parsers, FOAF+SSL authentication modules,
etc. He is also a co- inventor of the FOAF+SSL protocol.
</p>

<p>
<strong><a href="http://www.kjetil.kjernsmo.net/">Kjetil
Kjernsmo</a></strong> is the local organiser, and has been following
the RDF world since 1998. He prefers to write in Perl and has a few
relevant modules on <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/~kjetilk/">CPAN</a> including
RDF::RDFa::Template. While a member of the Semantic Web Education and
Outreach IG, he took the initiative to the <a
href="http://esw.w3.org/SweoIG/TaskForces/CommunityProjects">Community
Projects</a>, that lead to the <a href="http://linkeddata.org/">Linked
Open Data</a> project. He has also been a member of the POWDER and
SPARQL WGs.
</p>

<p>

The hackathon will convene at 13:00 local time on Monday 19th of April
and run through Wednesday 21st of April. The venue is the offices of
<a href="http://www.startsiden.no/">ABC Startsiden</a> with the
address Sagveien 21a.
</p>
<p>
We will identify a number of subjects that would be interesting to
hack on leading up to the event. The discussion will take place on the
perlrdf mailing list, please <a
href="http://lists.perlrdf.org/listinfo/dev">add yourself</a> and see
prior posts in the archives.
</p>
<p>
The current concensus centers around:

</p>

<ul>
<li>RDFS reasoning</li>
<li>ACL-protected subclass of RDF::Trine::Store based on RDF::ACL.</li>
<li>Finish RDF::Endpoint.</li>
<li>Use FOAF+SSL to limit access to data on the endpoint using RDF::ACL.</li>
</ul>

<p>
There
are <a href="http://kasei.us/wiki/index.php?title=PerlRDF_Hackathon_Ideas">more
    topics in the wiki</a>.

<p>
Further topics are welcomed and the agenda will be adjusted according
to wishes of the participants.
</p>
<p>
Participants will need to organize transportation and accomodation for
themselves, but there is no conference fee.
