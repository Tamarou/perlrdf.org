<h1>Hacking RDF with Perl Hackathon in London, UK, 28-30. March 2011.</h1>

<div class="text">
<p>

We are proud to announce
the first International Hacking RDF with Perl Hackathon in London, UK from the 28th to the 30th of March 2010. 
The venue is <a href="http://london.hackspace.org.uk/">The London Hackspace</a>. 

</p>


<h2>People</h2>
<p>
These prominent hackers are coming to the event:
</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="http://kasei.us/">Gregory Todd Williams</a></strong>
is the author of <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/RDF-Trine/">RDF::Trine</a> and <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/RDF-Query/">RDF::Query</a>. He is a
Ph.D. student at the <a href="http://tw.rpi.edu/">Tetherless World Constellation</a> group at the
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and a prominent member of the SPARQL
Working Group, where he is the editor of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2009/WD-sparql11-service-description-20091022/">SPARQL 1.1 Service
Description</a>.
</p>
<p>
<strong><a href="http://tobyinkster.co.uk/">Toby Inkster</a></strong>
is the author of a large number of RDF-related Perl modules on <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/~tobyink/">CPAN</a>, including RDFa
parsers, HTML5 microdata parsers, FOAF+SSL authentication modules,
etc. He is also a co- inventor of the FOAF+SSL protocol.
</p>

<p>
<strong><a href="http://www.kjetil.kjernsmo.net/">Kjetil
Kjernsmo</a></strong> is organizing the event. He is currently a
Ph.D. student the <a href="http://www.ifi.uio.no/">University of Oslo,
Norway</a>, and has been following the RDF world since 1998. He
prefers to write in Perl and has a few relevant modules on <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/~kjetilk/">CPAN</a> including
RDF::LinkedData, Test::RDF and RDF::RDFa::Template. While a member of
the Semantic Web Education and Outreach IG, he took the initiative to
the <a
href="http://esw.w3.org/SweoIG/TaskForces/CommunityProjects">Community
Projects</a>, that lead to the <a href="http://linkeddata.org/">Linked
Open Data</a> project. He has also been a member of the POWDER and
SPARQL WGs.
</p>

<p>
<strong><a href="http://chris.prather.org/">Chris Prather</a></strong>
is the CEO of <a href="http://tamarou.com/">Tamarou LLC</a>, a small
consulting and development service company focusing on Perl-based
technologies. He currently consults on technology for several
entrepreneurs, is an active member of Moose developer team, and heads
up the Extended Core Working Group for the Enlightened Perl
Organisation. He is started the work on the Class::OWL module.
</p>

<p>
<strong><a href="http://perldition.org/">Florian Ragwitz</a></strong>,
when he isn't busy contributing to one of many Perl communities, such
as Moose, Catalyst, or DBIx::Class, helps building the Debian
GNU/Linux distribution. He's also one of the developers of the Perl 5
interpreter and the XMMS2 music player, and occasionally sends a patch
to other open-source projects such as the Git or the Linux kernel.
When he isn't writing software, he's probably busy playing bass guitar
or one of the electronic drum kits he built using free software and a
bunch of microcontrollers.
</p>


<p>
<strong>Espen Borgen</strong> is a developer with the hackathon's
sponsor <a href="http://www.startsiden.no/">ABC Startsiden</a>, which
runs one of Norway's most trafficked websites. There, he is the lead
developer for the migration of mission-critical legacy systems to
Moose and DBIx::Class. He is also following up on the company visions
for the Semantic Web.
</p>

<h2>Topics</h2>

<p>
We will identify a number of subjects that would be interesting to
hack on leading up to the event. The discussion will take place on the
perlrdf mailing list, please <a
href="http://lists.perlrdf.org/listinfo/dev">add yourself</a> and see
prior posts in the archives.
</p>
<p>
The current concensus centers around:

</p>

<ul>
<li>RDFS reasoning</li>
<li>ACL-protected subclass of RDF::Trine::Store based on RDF::ACL.</li>
<li>Finish RDF::Endpoint.</li>
<li>Use FOAF+SSL to limit access to data on the endpoint using RDF::ACL.</li>
<li>High-level APIs for RDF and SPARQL</li>

</ul>

<p>
There
are <a href="http://kasei.us/wiki/index.php?title=PerlRDF_Hackathon_Ideas">more
    topics in the wiki</a>.
</p>
<p>
Further topics are welcomed and the agenda will be adjusted according
to wishes of the participants.
</p>
<p>


</p>

<h2>Attending</h2>

<p>
This is not an event for learning Perl or RDF, nor is it an event for
discussing the feasibility of the Semantic Web. This is event for
those who just wants to code to make it happen. To this end,
participants are expected to have prior knowledge of the technologies,
and must be able to produce code and willing to license it free and
upload it to <a href="http://search.cpan.org/">CPAN</a>.
</p>

<p>
For industry or academic participants, there will be a small fee to
cover the costs of lunch and dinner. You are expected to find your own
accommodation and transportation. We are particularly interested in
developers who can help integrate triplestores or reasoners with the
infrastructure that we have already.
</p>

<p>
<a href="mailto:kjetil@kjernsmo.net">Please state your interest by e-mail.</a>
</p>

<p>
For those who want to learn Perl and RDF, we will organise a
dissemenation workshop at the <a
href="http://wims.vestforsk.no/">International Conference on Web
Intelligence, Mining and Semantics (WIMS'11)</a>. You are encourage to
register and participate at this conference.
