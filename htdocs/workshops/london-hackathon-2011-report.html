<h1>Report from the First International "Semantic Web with Perl" Hackathon</h1>

<p>Held at the London Hackspace from the 27th to the 30th of March 2011.</p>

<div class="text">

<h2>Participants and what they focused on</h2>

<p>Dmitry Tsarkov and Toby Inkster worked mostly on adding reasoning
capabilities to the Perl stack.</p>

<p>Gregory Todd Williams, Mischa Tuffield and Robert Barta worked on
query engines mostly.</p>

<p>Florian Ragwitz made a great contribution to the above by providing
his XS-expertise, which was instrumental in getting the Perl layer
working with the C layer.</p>

<p>Chris Prather and Espen Borgen made a major refactoring of
RDF::Helper to resurrect it from the dead.</p>

<p>Finally, Kjetil Kjernsmo, worked on configuration systems, testing,
and generally roaming around, coordinating and organizing the
hackathon.</p>

<h2>Areas of development</h2>

<h3>Reasoning</h3>

<p>
The main goals of this activity was to enable reasoning engines to be
used from Perl. To this end, we wanted to have a pure-perl reasoner,
now known as <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/~tobyink/RDF-Closure/">RDF::Closure</a>,
and the possibility to call the C++-based reasoner <a
href="http://owl.man.ac.uk/factplusplus/">FaCT++</a> from Perl. This
was achieved by FaCT++ getting a C API that can be used through an XS
bridge. Further, an implementation of OWL Functional Syntax was made
on both sides to achieve integration. The new module <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/~tobyink/OWL-DirectSemantics/">OWL::DirectSemantics</a>
has been released with more than 2000 lines of code and 3000 lines of
documentation.
</p>

<h3>High-level API</h3>

<p>
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/RDF-Helper/">RDF::Helper</a> was
written by Kip Hampton and Mike Nachbaur (neither of whom could make
it) in 2004-2006 to provide a consistent and more Perlish API towards
the various toolsets that existed at the time. Meanwhile, <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/~gwilliams/RDF-Trine/">RDF::Trine</a>
solved half of the problems that RDF::Helper set out to solve.
</p>

<p>
It was decided to drop the goal of integration across toolsets, and
rather concentrate the effort on RDF::Helper being a high-level API on
the top of RDF::Trine. The <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Redland/">RDF::Redland</a> was
nevertheless retained to be able to confirm that all tests passed also
after the major refactoring.
</p>

<p>
Moose was used in the refactoring, and RDF::Helper itself is now an
interesting example on how to refactor an old module to use Moose,
while retaining the old API.
</p>
<p>
RDF::Helper is now in a releasable state, pending upload to CPAN. It
now uses Dist::Zilla for the packaging.
</p>
<p>
Finally, work to bring <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Class-OWL/">Class::OWL</a> onto the
new RDF::Helper was started. Class::MOP had changed underneath it, but
the necessary changes were done to bring it uptodate with these
changes.  It was decided that more work on OWL Direct Semantics is
also needed to advance it.
</p>

<h3>Store integration work</h3>
<p>
A major goal of the hackathon was to integrate <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/~gwilliams/RDF-Trine/">RDF::Trine</a> and
<a href="http://search.cpan.org/~gwilliams/RDF-Query/">RDF::Query</a>
with other quad store backends. The emphasis was on 4store and
AllegroGraph, since they were represented by people close to the code.
</p>

<p>
Originally, RDF::Query decomposed an incoming SPARQL query into
algebra object, which was passed to a query planner for execution
using RDF::Trine's API. It was decided that it should be able for a
backend store to signal to RDF::Trine that it was willing to deal with
the whole query execution process itself, and so that RDF::Query would
not attempt to parse the query, but rather send the whole query down
to the backend. Yet, the functionality provided by RDF::Trine should
be supported as well.
</p>

<h4>AllegroGraph</h4>
<p>
<a href="http://franz.com/agraph/allegrograph/">AllegroGraph</a> takes
advantage of this bypass-behaviour of RDF::Trine, and a new
RDF::Trine::Store::AllegroGraph is now ready for release, pending the
release of RDF::Trine. This is to be considered a public beta, as some
more work is required to make it completely usable for mainstream
usage.
</p>

<h4>4store</h4>

<p>
A lot of work was done on <a href="http://4store.org/">4store</a>
internals to make integration possible. Like AllegroGraph, 4store also
takes advantage of the bypass-behaviour. 4store is now packaged using
autoconf and it exposes a C API, which is something that was created
during the hackathon. Code is also written to use this C API from
RDF::Trine. To get this into a releaseable state, more coordination is
needed with the core 4store developers, but the required programming
time is down to a few hours. When this is done, and 4store has gone
through the Garlik QA process, a new 4store release is expected, and
then a new RDF::Trine::Store::FourStore release will be done.
</p>

<h4>Testing</h4>

<p>
Code to test stores have previously been confined to individual test
cases, but since they are common to many different stores, they will
be available in the RDF::Trine distribution as a new module
Test::RDF::Trine::Store which can be called as old-style functions to
test any store, and give a fair impression of whether the driver works
as expected.
</p>

<h3>Configuration system evaluation</h3>

<p>
The configuration system has two issues we wanted to resolve: First,
field keys, were inconsistent, e.g. the base URI was denoted
<tt>base</tt> in some applications, and <tt>base_uri</tt> in
others. In addition, some users had expressed concerns with the long
dependency chain of <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Config-JFDI/">Config::JFDI</a>,
which is currently used.
</p>

<p>
A survey was made to see if any alternatives would fulfil all the
requirements, of being able to merge different configuration files,
but also use environment variables to control certain behaviour, such
as the location of the configuration files. It was not found any other
modules that would fully replace Config::JFDI and it was decided that
since the dependencies are rather common modules, it should not be a
concern great enough to warrant spending a lot of time on for now.
</p>

<p>
This was further resolved with regards to consistency of configuration fields:
</p>
<dl>
<dt>store</dt>
<dd>Used to configure a RDF::Trine::Store. The value of this key can
be passed directly to the constructor.</dd>

<dt>base_uri</dt>
<dd>The base URI used to create absolute URIs from relative URIs.</dd>

<dt>namespaces</dt>
<dd>A key-value hashref containing prefixes and keys and a single
namespace URI as value</dd>

<dt>update</dt>
<dd>A boolean value indicating whether Update operations should be
allowed to be executed.
</dd>

<dt>load_data</dt>
<dd>A boolean value indicating whether and RDF::Endpoint should use
URLs that appear in FROM and FROM NAMED clauses to construct a SPARQL
dataset by dereferencing the URLs and loading the retrieved RDF
content.</dd>  

<dt>service_description</dt>

<dd>An associative array (hash) containing details on which and how
much information to include in the service description provided by an
endpoint if no query is included for execution. The boolean values
'<tt>default</tt>' and '<tt>named_graphs</tt>' indicate that the
respective SPARQL dataset graphs should be described by the service
description.</dd>

</dl>

<h3>Other things</h3>

<p>We also had a lengthy discussion about the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Redland/">RDF::Redland</a> module, as
it is outdated on CPAN but is important to provide better performance
for Perl users. We also discussed if we should replace the SWIG
interface with an XS interface, but it was decided against that. A new
CPAN package was created, and it turned out to be quite
straightforward.
</p>

<p>
RDF::Endpoint is now nearing release.
</p>

<p>
A developer release of Test::RDF was made, an ordinary release will be
done once RDF::Trine is released.
</p>


<h3>What we didn't do (much)</h3>

<p>
The big <a href="http://moose.perl.org/">Moose</a> (which is an
Meta-object-protocol-based object system) discussion didn't
happen. That is not to say that there weren't a lot of Moose work
being done, and that the value of migrating the rest of the modules
weren't recognized, quite the contrary. It is already clear that there
would be great value in migrating RDF::Trine and RDF::Query to Moose,
and a discussion was held that made it clear that the diversity of RDF
query engines made it desireable to have a Moose::Role based
architecture. However, there were already so many important tasks to
be undertaken for the integration that did happen on the hackathon
that the detailed discussion about how we should use Moose to achieve
more long-term goals was deferred to a later hackathon.
</p>

<p>
Further work on <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/~tobyink/RDF-ACL/">RDF::ACL</a> did not
happen either, partly because it was felt that to significantly
advance it, it would need more OWL, which was a major topic.


</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>
This hackathon made a real ecosystem of the Perl and Semantic Web
community. A large amount of code was written, and many outstanding
issues were resolved. In spite of the good digital competence of the
participants, it is clear that such advances can only be made by
meeting in real life.
</p>
<p>
The organizer wishes to thank all the participants for their
contribution, and for a good time. Another thanks goes to the London
Hackspace for providing an excellent venue for the hackathon.
